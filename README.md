The course "CS 450 Operating Systems" provided a comprehensive understanding of operating systems and their functions. The course emphasized communication through platforms such as Piazza and the importance of the textbook "Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces" by Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau. It covered essential prerequisites like system programming skills and UNIX environment familiarity, along with knowledge of data structures and algorithms.

The course components included lectures, exams, lab assignments, and homework. The topics covered a wide range of operating system concepts, including process scheduling, synchronization, memory management, file systems, and computer security. Students engaged in hands-on lab assignments and projects that focused on different aspects of operating systems, such as environment setup, system calls, process and memory management, and penetration testing.

The grading structure allocated significant weight to lab assignments and exams, with a goal to ensure that everyone achieved an A. The course provided a balanced combination of theory and practical implementation, covering critical topics in operating systems and allowing students to gain real-world experience. Through lectures, assignments, and projects, students gained insights into the complexities and functionalities of modern operating systems.
